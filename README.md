# News-Automation
First lines of code I ever wrote. Automation with python3.

Working at a news radio entails some boring and repetitive tasks. One of those tasks was to create and fill 24 back-office pages, everyday, with text generated daily by an excel file with some excel formulas.

Here's how it went:

1. Logging in to the back-office website.
2. Creating a new page.
3. Filling the forms on the page (title, date of publication, author, etc. etc.) by copy + paste from an excel file.
5. Saving it.
6. Repeat it 23 times.
7. Do it again the next day.

With this python script I can run it once and the 24 pages will be created and filled accordingly. Or I can schedule it to run everyday and forget about it.
